          My name is
          <i>Yugesh Baral</i> all the way from
          <b>Kathmandu, Nepal</b>
          . I am currently {{ age }} years old. I am currently studying
          <b>Computer Engineering</b>.
          And the most important thing "If there is anything after air for survival, it's
          <i>Computers</i> for me"!
        </p>
        <p>
          My weekday activies(
          <i>which are boring</i>) includes 75% studying, 15% sleeping, 5% eating and 5% playing with mobile and computers.
          But my weekend is real fun. I enjoy myself 75% with using computers and learning new stuffs. The rest are the same... I really like sleeping too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been using computer since the age of 13. And most of the stuffs I know today; after {{ age - 13 }} years of using computers
          are self learned. I really enjoy learning new stuffs (
          <i>NOT BOOKS</i>) and experimenting with them. Doing so really puts a smile on my face.
          I am impatient as well, result of which I keep hoping to new stuffs, learn them for the basics and hop again to new stuff.
          But I am gained some good knowledge with few of what I have learnt.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have good hands of knowledge on Javascript and
          <i>Node.js</i>. Also I have started using Nuxt.js to create all the necessity of my web app frontends.
          Even this entire Site is built using Nuxt.js. Alongside it I use Bootstrap to give classy looks to my websites.
          I am heading further to gain a level of expertise on Python and AI as well.
